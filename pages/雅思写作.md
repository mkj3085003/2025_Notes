- Permissive parenting answer放任型父母
	- Some parents buy their children whatever they ask for, and allow their children to do whatever they want. Is this a good way to raise children? What consequences could ==this style of parenting== have for children as they get older?
		- 有些父母会给孩子买他们要求的任何东西，并允许孩子为所欲为。这是一种好的育儿方式吗？这种育儿方式会对孩子长大后产生什么后果呢？
	- It is true that some parents are ==overly permissive== and tend to ==spoil their children==. In my opinion, this is not a good parenting style, and it can have a range of negative long-term consequences.
		- 的确，有些父母过于放任，容易溺爱孩子。在我看来，这不是一种好的育儿方式，它会带来一系列负面的长期后果。
	- ==If parents want to raise respectful and well-behaved children, I believe that a certain amount of discipline is necessary.== Having worked with children myself, I have learnt that clear expectations and boundaries are necessary, and it is important to be able to say 'no' to children when they misbehave or try to push against these boundaries. This is the only way to help young people to regulate their desires and develop self-control. In my view, parents who do the opposite and constantly give in to their children's demands, are actually doing more harm than good. They are failing their children rather than being kind to them.
		- 如果父母想要培养出有礼貌且行为良好的孩子，我认为有必要进行一定量的管教。我自己也和孩子打过交道，我了解到明确的期望和界限是必需的，当孩子行为不端或试图突破这些界限时，能够对他们说“不”也很重要。只有这样，才能帮助年轻人调节自己的欲望，培养自制力。在我看来，那些反其道而行之、不断满足孩子要求的父母，实际上是在给孩子带来伤害，而不是对他们好。他们是在辜负孩子，而不是对孩子友善。
	- The children of ==indulgent== or ==lenient== parents are likely to grow up with several negative personality traits. The first and most obvious danger is that these children will become self-centred adults who show little conversation for the feelings or needs of others. One consequence of such an attitute could be that these adults are unable to work successfully in teams with other colleagues. A second negative trait in such people could be impulsiveness. A person who has never lived with any boundaries is likely to lack the patience to carefully consider options before making decisions. This my lead, for example, to compulsive shopping, unwise financial decisions, or even criminal activity.
		- 溺爱或宽容的父母的孩子长大后可能会形成几种负面的性格特征。第一个也是最明显的一个危险是，这些孩子会成为自私的成年人，对他人的情感或需求很少关心。这种态度的一个后果可能是，这些成年人无法与同事成功地在团队中工作。这类人可能具有的第二个负面特征是冲动。一个从未生活在任何界限中的人，很可能缺乏在做决定前仔细考虑选项的耐心。这可能会导致例如强迫性购物、不明智的财务决策，甚至犯罪行为。
	- In conclusion, parents should help their children to develop self-control and respect for others, and I do not believe that the perimissive parenting style supports this objective.

	- 总之，父母应该帮助孩子培养自制力和对他人的尊重，我不认为放任型育儿方式能够支持这一目标。
